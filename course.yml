title            : Causal Inference with R - Regression
description: In solidarity with the DataCamp instructors who are protesting the recent corporate response to behavior of a member of its executive staff, we have suspended this course.  If and when DataCamp has made a satisfactory response to this situation, we will make the course available again. We still have materials about causal inference at our website (https://modu.ssri.duke.edu).  To learn more about the events at DataCamp, you can read the following letter signed by 100 DataCamp instructors: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gWqAlf7yhDBCZhkbLUysOCmMl58IrVdG26C8Hiy9b-I
